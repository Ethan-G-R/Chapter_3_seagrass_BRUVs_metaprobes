# Chapter_3_seagrass_BRUVs_metaprobes

Metaprobes are 3D printed, perforated spheres that collect eDNA passively onto rolls of cotton bandage gauze https://github.com/GiuliaMaiello/Metaprobe-2.1. They are an alternative to filtering seawater to collect eDNA. In this work, the teleost fish species detected by eDNA collected by metaprobes is compared to those recorded by baited remote underwater video (BRUV) to assess if the metaprobes collect eDNA from the species present on a seagrass bed at Loch Eishort Scotland.
